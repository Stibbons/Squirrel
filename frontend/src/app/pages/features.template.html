              A quite ambitious project coming from a modest idea born early 2014.

            <p translate>

              Hi! My name is Gaetan Semet. I am Software engineer who started a very humble investor
              life in 2014 and was very disappointed with existing tools to follow my different
              portfolios.

            </p>
            <p translate>

              I opened several accounts on several broker, to exploit the best of each contract.
              Each contract has its own avdantages, and drawbacks. For example, my first stocks
              broker was quite good for stocks from my home country (France), but was over expensive
              for stocks abroad. I then opened another account on a cheaper broker of US stocks.

            </p>
            <p translate>

              I also wanted to follow the Mutual Funds I had on contracts opened by my company. I
              wanted to tracke them like I would do with stocks.

            </p>
          </question-and-answer>
          <question-and-answer question="{{'So how do you managed to follow your different portfolios?' | translate}}">
            <p translate>

              Like many people, I started tracking my different stocks and mutual funds using a
              speadsheet software. But I felt very restricted when using such software, without
              beneficting from modern tools, dynamic and interactives charts such as what we can see
              on the web. If services like Dropbox allow you to have access to you file while on the
              go, you still need the software to open and check it.

            </p>
            <p translate>

              So I started using Google Spreadsheet to follow my investments, and I felt in love
              with its the 100% online nature. No matter which day of the week we are, if I am at
              home or on the go, I could see and edit my portfolio instantanously.

            </p>
            <p translate>

              But when data start to becomes quite heavy, with lot of custom import scripts, the
              Speadsheet started slowing down and become less confortable to work with. Ultimately,
              I was not able to open it on my mobile phone, even the tablet crashed.

            </p>
            <p>

              <translate>

                I was also disappointed by the graphs themselves, they were not customable enough
                and not so good looking, compared to graph produced by JavaScript libraries such as

            <p translate>

              Squirrel started as a personal work but I wanted to do it the right way, with cutting
              edge web technologies. And though maybe one day I could release it as a real service.

          <question-and-answer question="{{'How long does it take to build a web site like Squirrel?' | translate}}">
            <p translate>

              I took several months of hard evening work, first to learn web technologies and to
              build this web site.

            <p translate>

              Squirrel is built in Angular and Python.

            <p translate>

              As a reminder, Squirrel is able to follow the price evolution of almost any kind of
              Stocks and Mutual Fonds valorisation or Bonds. So, you only have to manually enter
              price of funds that are not publically available.

              Unfortunately, Squirrel cannot retrieve automatically the movement you execute on your
              different accounts, such as buying a Stock or selling a mutual fund share. The first
              step would be to sign a contract with every broker, connect, and retrieve this
              information. It is a large number of contract to sign, and lot of these brokers and
              banks do not want, or do not have the culture to share this information.
              Interoperability is not a common word in the financial world.

              The major issue to deal with is security. "Reading" data from your account means it is
              also possible to send orders. This would requires to store your credential on Squirrel
              server, and this is definitely not a good idea. Even with all means taken to protect
              all these sensitives information, such as "bank level cryptography", this would break
              the golden rule "Don't put all your eggs in the same basket", since all your passwords
              are at a single place. There is no simple say to garantee a total security in this
              sector, at one point all your password will need to be decrypted before being sent to
              your broker. We can setup what we call a "Two way authentication" technic, but this
              would not allow automatically, transparent update. This is the only way to avoid
              Squirrel to ever "know" your password at one point in the system.

            </p>
            <p translate>

              The only solution that I can imagine is to cypher your credentials with the highest
              level of possible cryptography, that cannot be ever decyphered by the Squirrel server.
              The web interface would requires your to enter the passphrase and connect itself to
              your different brokers. In other word, I would be like if you would manually retrieve
              these data from your browser. Maybe one day this will be real!

            </p>
            <p translate>

              Until this moment, unfortunately, you have to manually update your operations. But
              don't be affraid, Squirrel is pretty confortable and this is quite easy to do.
